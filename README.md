# Game-Engine

To run my code, you can:

⚫ enter the corresponding folder

⚫ double click the “Server.jar”. Then a Processing sketch appears on the screen. Then you can see the game world has been created.

⚫ double click the “Client.jar”. Then a game character appears on the sketch. you can control it through the client window.

⚫ youcanrunthe“Client.jar”severaltimestocreatemultiplegamecharacters.Each can only be controlled in their own client window.

Another way to run my code:

⚫ all the codes are in the “src” folder

⚫ import the source code with the exact file structures in the folder “CSC591_Project_3”. ⚫ put the script folder in the same directory with the “src” folder created by eclipse.

⚫ import processing. Details are in https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/.

⚫ run “Server.java” in the “Network” folder.

⚫ run “Client.java” in the “Network” folder.

⚫ you can run “Client.java” several times to set up multiple game characters.

Specific details for Part 1:

The way you can control the game characters:

Note: All the user inputs should be input in the client. And all the letters are LOWER case

⚫ press “p”: pause. You can pause any time, even in the recording or replay.

⚫ press “u”: un-pause

⚫ press “1”: slow the time (0.5x). You can change time speed anytime, even in the recording or replay.
